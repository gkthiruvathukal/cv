	abstract = {This is the final report for the Ad Hoc Human Interaction Nets project. All tasks described in our original proposal have been completed: Hybrid-Hierarchical Micro-Databases, Query Optimization, and XML for Embedded Systems. After meeting with the program manager, Tom Armour, in Washington, DC, we were able to get a better perspective on the ad hoc nature of the solicitation. Armed with this perspective, we were able to complete two substantial prototypes to address the four tasks as originally written that works with Pocket PC and Palm OS devices. We were able to evaluate the viability of the Sharp Zaurus platform as well but ultimately decided to limit our focus to Palm OS and Pocket PC devices, which appear to have the greatest market interest and viability at the time of writing. Acquiring the hardware enabled us to make substantial progress on the ad hoc networking issues. In our networking prototype, which is based on the Pocket PC platform, we were able to take advantage of the emerging. Net compact framework and use it to build a distributed services and database framework. In this report, we will describe the two concept prototypes that were developed to demonstrate the feasibility of ad hoc human interaction networks and then proceed with a brief discussion of each task as written in the original proposal.},

	abstract = {COVID-19 has resulted in a worldwide pandemic, leading to "lockdown" policies and social distancing. The pandemic has profoundly changed the world. Traditional methods for observing these historical events are difficult because sending reporters to areas with many infected people can put the reporters' lives in danger. New technologies are needed for safely observing responses to these policies. This paper reports using thousands of network cameras deployed worldwide for the purpose of witnessing activities in response to the policies. The network cameras can continuously provide real-time visual data (image and video) without human efforts. Thus, network cameras can be utilized to observe activities without risking the lives of reporters. This paper describes a project that uses network cameras to observe responses to governments' policies during the COVID-19 pandemic (March to April in 2020). The project discovers over 30,000 network cameras deployed in 110 countries. A set of computer tools are created to collect visual data from network cameras continuously during the pandemic. This paper describes the methods to discover network cameras on the Internet, the methods to collect and manage data, and preliminary results of data analysis. This project can be the foundation for observing the possible "second wave" in fall 2020. The data may be used for post-pandemic analysis by sociologists, public health experts, and meteorologists.},

	abstract = {Machine learning techniques are becoming a fundamental tool for scientific and engineering progress. These techniques are applied in contexts as diverse as astronomy and spam filtering. However, correctly applying these techniques requires careful engineering. Much attention has been paid to the technical potential; relatively little attention has been paid to the software engineering process required to bring research-based machine learning techniques into practical utility. Technology companies have supported the engineering community through machine learning frameworks such as TensorFLow and PyTorch, but the details of how to engineer complex machine learning models in these frameworks have remained hidden. To promote best practices within the engineering community, academic institutions and Google have partnered to launch a Special Interest Group on Machine Learning Models (SIGMODELS) whose goal is to develop exemplary implementations of prominent machine learning models in community locations such as the TensorFlow Model Garden (TFMG). The purpose of this report is to define a process for reproducing a state-of-the-art machine learning model at a level of quality suitable for inclusion in the TFMG. We define the engineering process and elaborate on each step, from paper analysis to model release. We report on our experiences implementing the YOLO model family with a team of 26 student researchers, share the tools we developed, and describe the lessons we learned along the way.},

My CV
======

This is my CV in LaTeX. It demonstrates the following:

- Making effective use of the *excellent* Modern CV theme (moderncv).
- Managing my bibliographic entries with *separate* `.bib` files. This makes it easy to check whether I have included all of my publications and other research artifacts.
- Using `\printbibliography` to manage the different types of publications (e.g. conference papers, journal articles, magazine articles, books, etc.)
- Programmatically obtaining and inserting Google Scholar and GitHub metrics.
- Using texlive action to build the CV on every commit.
- Releasing the `.bib` and `.pdf` at https://github.com/gkthiruvathukal/cv/releases whenever a given commit is tagged with `git tag v<version>`

Yes, there are excellent GUIs for LaTeX (e.g. Overleaf), which I use for day-to-day work. This is one situation where I decided to use a regular GitHub repo, because I need to generate some of the content for various sections in my CV. Hopefully, one day, such scripting would be possible on the hosted LaTeX Solutions. Even so, GitHub Actions allows me to do all of the *good stuff* without much pain/suffering.

\subsection{Peer-to-Peer Filesystems and Scalable I/O}

Worked with Peter Aarestad, Benjamin Gonzalez, and Joe Kaylor (graduate students) on experimental filesystems based on the FUSE project. FUSE is a framework for building filesystems in user space. The notable aspect of FUSE is that you don't need to change the operating system kernel code to add your own filesystem. There are many examples of "cool" filesystem projects based on FUSE, one of which is the famous FlickrFS, which allows you to browse and edit your photo albums at Flickr just as if it were on your own hard drive (but really is a network filesystem).

\item{I was a "fresher representative" in my 2nd and 3rd years of university, this required me to guide, look after, and ensure that a particular flat of first years have a good time in their first week, and feel consoled in what for most of them is there first time living away from home. We were responsible for the safety and wellbeing of the group of first years during the first week, and during this time I made good friends with all of them.}

\item{I am a member of a number of university societies. I was also the vice president and co-founder of the flash mob society. My roles in this included recruiting members, in which during "fresher's fair" we enlisted over 200 new members. This was regarded as very successful, considering other societies averaged around 50. I also appeared in an interview on the university television station, set up a society bank account, and helped organise the events. One of these events was featured in the local newspaper.}

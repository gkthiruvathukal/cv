abstract = {As we add more autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles (AVs) to our roads, their effects on passenger and pedestrian safety are becoming more important. Despite extensive testing before deployment, AV systems are not perfect at identifying hazards in the roadway. Although a particular AVâ€™s sensors and software may not be 100\% accurate at identifying hazards, there is an untapped pool of information held by other AVs in the vicinity that could be used to quickly and accurately identify roadway hazards before they present a safety threat.},

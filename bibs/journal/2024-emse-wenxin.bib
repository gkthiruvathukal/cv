	abstract = {Many engineering organizations are reimplementing and extending deep neural networks from the research community. We describe this process as deep learning model reengineering. Deep learning model reengineering — reusing, replicating, adapting, and enhancing state-of-the-art deep learning approaches — is challenging for reasons including under-documented reference models, changing requirements, and the cost of implementation and testing.},

 year = {1994},
 abstract = {Heterogeneous distributed and parallel computing environments are highly dependent on hardware and communication protocols. The result is significant difficulty in software reuse, portability across platforms, interoperability, and an increased overall development effort. A new systems engineering approach is needed for parallel processing systems in heterogeneous environments. The generic modeling framework de-emphasizes platform- specific development while exploiting software reuse (and platform-specific capabilities) with a simple, well defined, and easily integrated set of abstractions providing a high level of heterogeneous interoperability.},

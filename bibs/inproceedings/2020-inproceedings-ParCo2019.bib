 abstract = {The interdisciplinary field of neuroscience has made significantprogress in recent decades, providing the scientific community in gen-eral with a new level of understanding on how the brain works beyondthe  store-and-fire  model  found  in  traditional  neural  networks.  Mean-while,  Machine  Learning  (ML)  based  on  established  models  has  seena  surge  of  interest  in  the  High  Performance  Computing  (HPC)  com-munity,  especially  through  the  use  of  high-end  accelerators,  such  asGraphical  Processing  Units  (GPUs),  including  HPC  clusters  of  same.In our work, we are motivated to exploit these high-performance com-puting  developments  and  understand  the  scaling  challenges  for  new–biologically inspired–learning models on leadership-class HPC resources.These  emerging  models  feature  sparse  and  random  connectivity  pro-files  that  map  to  more  loosely-coupled  parallel  architectures  with  alarge number of CPU cores per node. Contrasted with traditional MLcodes, these methods exploit loosely-coupled sparse data structures asopposed  to  tightly-coupled  dense  matrix  computations,  which  benefitfrom SIMD-style parallelism found on GPUs. In this paper we introducea hybrid Message Passing Interface (MPI) and Open Multi-Processing(OpenMP) parallelization scheme to accelerate and scale our computa-tional model based on the dynamics of cortical tissue. We ran compu-tational tests on a leadership class visualization and analysis cluster atArgonne National Laboratory. We include a study of strong and weakscaling, where we obtained parallel efficiency measures with a minimumabove 87\% and a maximum above 97\% for simulations of our biologicallyinspired neural network on up to 64 computing nodes running 8 threadseach. This study shows promise of the MPI+OpenMP hybrid approachto support flexible and biologically-inspired computational experimen-tal scenarios. In addition, we present the viability in the application ofthese strategies in high-end leadership computers in the future.},

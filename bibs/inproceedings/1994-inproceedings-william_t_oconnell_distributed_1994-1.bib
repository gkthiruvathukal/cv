 abstract = {Heterogeneously distributed and parallel computing environments are highly dependent on hardware, data migration, and protocols. The result is significant difficulty in software reuse, portability across platforms, and an increased overall development effort. The appearance of a shared directory of unordered queues can be provided by integrating heterogeneous computers transparently. This integration provides a conducive environment for parallel and distributed application development, by abstracting the issues of hardware and communication. Object oriented technology is exploited to provide this seamless environment.},

 abstract = {Threading and concurrency are crucial to building high-performance Java applications -- but they have a reputation for complexity. High Performance Java Computing thoroughly demystifies these advanced development techniques. It delivers practical programming solutions, proven design patterns, and a rigorously-tested code library -- everything developers need to build optimized Java software for technical, business, and E-commerce applications. Start by understanding how threading and concurrency can be used to solve a wide variety of performance problems, enabling the construction of more powerful networked applications. Master the Java 2 Threads classes, including daemon threads, thread control, scheduling, and more. Review the key problems of parallelism -- including deadlocks, race conditions, and synchronization -- and discover proven techniques for avoiding or resolving them. Finally, master advanced techniques for building optimized concurrent code, including Java monitors, parallel execution of subroutines in shared memory, and parallelizing loops.}
